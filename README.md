# mtprotoproxy-go

Fast, minimal MTProto proxy powered by [mtg](https://github.com/9seconds/mtg) written in Go.

* FakeTLS with one secret (auto-generated if you don't provide one)
* Anti-replay cache and IPv6-preferred networking
* Prometheus metrics on `/metrics` (port 3129)
* Built as a static binary (~6 MB) and shipped in a distroless container

---

## Quick start (local)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/mtprotoproxy-go.git
cd mtprotoproxy-go
# build and run in foreground
docker compose up --build
```

The proxy listens on **127.0.0.1:3128** and prints a ready-to-use **tg://proxy** link.

---

## One-liner deployment on a VPS

```
scp -r . vps:/opt/mtproxy
ssh vps
cd /opt/mtproxy && ./deploy.sh 443   # optional: <public_port> [image_tag]
```

* Installs Docker if missing
* Builds the multi-arch image
* Starts container (`--restart unless-stopped`)
* Prints the Telegram client URL and the Prometheus endpoint
